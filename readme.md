# M-Calculator Version 1.0 

This is a small, dependency-free, native C libary for getting result of equations from strings

Notes:
- This library is only in version one; as such, it is missing a lot of features.
- You cannot do math with decimal numbers
- There is no operator precedent, it is just evaluated from left to right
- You cannot use parethesis to increase operator precedence

It's worth noting that this library is more proof of concept over actually having any useful application.
**It is not recommended that you try to use this library**. All the features mentioned above will be available in version 2.0+.

Integration Instructions:

Just include the library using "mcalc.h", and be sure to include the mcalc.c file in the compilation of the final executable
